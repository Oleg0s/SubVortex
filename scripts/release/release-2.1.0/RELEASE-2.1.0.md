2. **Upgrade Subnet**: Check if you are on main or on a tag

   ```bash
   git branch -vvv
   ```

   You will see something similar

   ```bash
   # If you are on a tag
   * (HEAD detached at v0.2.4)  d6e233a Merge pull request #13 from eclipsevortex/release/0.2.4

   # If you are on main
   * main                       13e555e [origin/main] Merge pull request #19 from eclipsevortex/release/2.0.0
   ```

   > IMPORTANT <br />
   > The \* tell you your active branch. It has to be hear on the tag on the main branch.

   If you are on a tag branch, checkout main

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

   Otherwise/Then, get the latest version of the subnet

   ```bash
   git pull
   ```

   Then, install the dependencies

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -e .
   ```

3. **Rollout Redis**: Rollout redis by running in **SubVortex** directory
   ```bash
   python3 ./scripts/release/release-2.1.0/migration.py
   ```

   You will see
   ```bash
   2024-03-30 13:12:25.887 |       INFO       | Loading database from localhost:6379
   2024-03-30 13:12:25.899 |       INFO       | Rollout starting              
   2024-03-30 13:12:25.932 |       INFO       | Rollout done                  
   2024-03-30 13:12:25.933 |       INFO       | Checking rollout...           
   2024-03-30 13:12:25.940 |       INFO       | Rollout checked successfully  
   ```

4. **Restart validator**: Restart your validator to take the new version into the new version

   ```bash
   pm2 restart validator-92
   ```

5. **Check logs**: Check the validator logs to see if you see some `New Block`
   ```bash
   pm2 logs validator-92
   ```

<br />

## Rollback Process <a id="validator-rollback-process"></a>

If any issues arise during or after the rollout, follow these steps to perform a rollback:

1. **Rollback Redis**: Rollback redis by running in **SubVortex** directory

   ```bash
   python3 ./scripts/migrations/release-2.1.0/migration.py --run-type rollback
   ```

   You should see

   ```bash
   2024-03-30 13:12:20.909 |       INFO       | Loading database from localhost:6379
   2024-03-30 13:12:20.920 |       INFO       | Rollback starting             
   2024-03-30 13:12:20.961 |       INFO       | Rollback done                 
   2024-03-30 13:12:20.961 |       INFO       | Checking rollback...          
   2024-03-30 13:12:20.962 |       INFO       | Rollback checked successfully 
   ```

   If any issue, restore your backup database using the [Backup Guide](../../migrations/backup.md#restore-a-dump).

2. **Downgrade Subnet**: Get the tags

   ```bash
   git fetch --tags
   ```

   Check tag v2.0.0 exist

   ```bash
   git tag
   ```

   Checkout the tag

   ```bash
   git checkout tags/v2.0.0
   ```

   you will see

   ```
   Note: switching to 'tags/v0.2.4'.

   You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
   changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
   state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

   If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
   do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

   git switch -c <new-branch-name>

   Or undo this operation with:

   git switch -

   Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

   HEAD is now at d6e233a Merge pull request #13 from eclipsevortex/release/0.2.4
   ```

   Then install the dependencies

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -e .
   ```

3. **Restart validator**: Restart your validator to take the new version into the new version

   ```bash
   pm2 restart validator-92
   ```

4. **Check logs**: Check the validator logs to see if you see some `New Block`
   ```bash
   pm2 logs validator-92
   ```
